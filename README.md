# UP Diliman CRS Math Professor Predictor

A tool for predicting the course professor of Math classes using class details (course number, day, room, semester, start/end time) powered by Random Forest Classifier (33.26% accuracy).

## Overview

UPD CRS Professor Predictor applies classification models (Random Forest & XGBoost) to predict which professor will teach a given Math course based on schedule-based features. It also includes a rule-based shortcut for classes taught by professors who only appear once in the dataset.

## Features

* **Hybrid Predictor**: Prioritizes exact scheduleâ€“prof mapping for single-class professors, then uses trained ML models for others.
* **Flexible Feature Handling**: Accepts schedule entries in military time like `"13:00"` and encodes day, room, semester properly (label or one-hot) to match training data.
* **Model Customization**: Implemented Random Forest and XGBoost (with parameter tuning options) with Random Forest performing better.
* **Streamlit UI**: Interactive web interface to enter class details and get predictions. Another feature is the schedule dashboard, which consists of graphs for easy checking of professor statistics.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ice-leo/UPD-CRS-Prof-Predictor.git
```

2. **Get the model**:
Run `CRS_Math_Profs_Predictor_RF.ipynb` or `CRS_Math_Profs_Predictor_XGBoost.ipynb` to get the pickle file (either `best_xgb_model.pkl` or `best_rf_model.pkl`).
---

3. **Modify `streamlit.py` code**:
Depending on your model of choice, modify:
```python
MODEL_PATH = r"C:\Users\Isaiah\Personal Projects\UP CRS Prof Predictor\best_{xgb or rf}_model.pkl"
```

## Usage

### Jupyter Notebook

Open either `CRS_Math_Profs_Predictor_RF.ipynb` or `CRS_Math_Profs_Predictor_XGBoost.ipynb` then use the `predict` function:

```python

predicted = predict(
    number=126,
    day="WF",
    room="MB 121",
    semester="2nd sem",
    start_time="13:00",
    end_time="14:30"
)
print("Predicted Professor:", predicted)
```

### Streamlit Web App

To launch the interactive web interface:

1. Launch IDE (VS Code).
2. Run `streamlit.py` in the IDE.
3. Run in command line:
```bash
python -m streamlit run "c:/path/to/your/project/streamlit_app.py"
```

The app provides fields for class number, day, room, semester, and start/end times. It displays the predicted professor. The app also has a dashboard for easy visualizations.

## Model Details

* **Random Forest**: Baseline model with manual hyperparameter tuning.
* **XGBoost**: Tuned using `StratifiedKFold` + `RandomizedSearchCV`, scoring based on accuracy.
* **One-class rule**: For professors with only one class, an exact-match dictionary maps the schedule to the professor directly.

---

## Development

To retrain models:

1. Update `CRS_Math_Profs_Database.ipynb` every year by setting `last_year` to the latest year.
2. Run `CRS_Math_Profs_Predictor_RF.ipynb` or `CRS_Math_Profs_Predictor_XGBoost.ipynb` to preprocess, split, train models, and export the best one.
3. The output includes:

   * `best_rf_model.pkl`
   * `best_xgb_model.pkl`
